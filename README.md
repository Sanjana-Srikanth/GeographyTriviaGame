A working geography trivia game!

I decided to build the Geography Trivia Game using CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I have had experience with these coding
languages before mainly in using them to build many small projects, even though I haven't used them for 
large scale web development. I learned a lot through this coding process and navigated many internet
resources to learn different concepts throughout the span of this challenge. I haven't had experience
coding API calls and using languages like Javascript as extensively. I am confident in the 
skills I gained through this process and I found it really gratifying to be able to quickly learn 
and grasp concepts that I initially found daunting and apply them to make a finished product
for this challenge. For this Geography Trivia game, I decided to code an input bar where the 
user can guess the country and receive back feedback on whether or not it is correct. Every correct
asnwer adds to the score which is displayed at the end. Each round lasts 60 seconds and ends if
you run out of time before completing all (four) questions in the round. There are 5
hints per round and each hint reveals a letter of the correct answer. At the end of the game,
the user has the option to replay and is notified of the score that they received. 

npm eg install is important and useful for downloading javascript packages. The command npm install- package name allows for the installation of the package through the terminal. These packages can come equipped with various features that are useful for code. For more program specifics, in order to connect the program to a live server that can be opened at any time the Live Program extension
available on VSCode is useful and is something that I utilized. In order to parse the csv file and use it to construct an array and perform functions that allow the trivia game to draw from its content, the PapaParse library integrated into VSCode provides a lot of functionalities to apply this. Specifically, it parses
csv data and has many integrated functions that allow for error catching and throwing, which I used
to ensure the csv data is being parsed and mapped correctly. Constructing the extracted questions into an array
and randomizing a selection of 4 questions, I was then able to use regular algorithmic coding with loops in order to set up the functionalities for the rest of the game, like the loop for the hint button and 
the displayQuestions() features. 

I initially struggled with API calls before understanding and being able to comfortably use it now
because I didn't have experience with that before. I enjoyed coding the different functions and 
progressively adding more features to the program especially the timer. I also loved utilizing
css to make the layout aesthetically pleasing and adding small details like moving the
button upwards when hovered over and adding shadows and contrast. Doing this challenge has really 
sparked my interest in trying out new coding projects and has made me realize just how accessible 
it is to learn new coding concepts espcially through the internet. Things that seemed 
daunting at first turned out to be really simple and something I was able to pick up quickly,
so I am incredibly excited to continue learning to code different things and 
expand my knowledge. 
I would absolutely love to learn how to apply these coding skills to more real-world projects
through Change++!
